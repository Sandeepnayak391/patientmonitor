Health Monitoring system using IOT describes the collection and interoperation of Patient data collected from the sensors from the hospitals through IOT Technology. The collected sensor data will support the doctor in the emergency situation for the betterment and improvement of Patient health. The hardware platform to implement the project consists of a sensor and Raspberry Pi 3 Model B equipped in a way to communicate with a doctor through the Internet and Smart Phone. This proposed idea will help doctors to know about the state of patient health and monitor anywhere in the world. In this proposed idea the sensors gather the medical information of the patient that includes patientâ€™s heart rate, blood pressure, and pulse rate Then using the camera the patient is livelily monitored through the Raspberry kit and this information is sent to the Internet and stored in a medical server. The doctor and patient can monitor the patient data from any place of the world through the provided IP server address anytime. The emergency alert is sent to the patient if the sensor value is exceeded by the threshold data. Thus the patient's health parameters are watched lively and regular monitoring through the medical server to a doctor will help to make an effective diagnosis and almost accurate care can be given. The data collected through the IOT will help the patient to recover easily and also enhanced medical care can be given to the patients at a low cost.
